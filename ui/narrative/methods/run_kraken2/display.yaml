    <p>This is a KBase wrapper for Kraken2, a taxonomic profiling tool. Kraken is a taxonomic sequence classifier that assigns taxonomic labels to DNA sequences. Kraken examines the k-mers within a query sequence and uses the information within those k-mers to query a database. That database maps k-mers to the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all genomes known to contain a given k-mer.
    The first version of Kraken used a large indexed and sorted list of k-mer/LCA pairs as its database. While fast, the large memory requirements posed some problems for users, and so Kraken 2 was created to provide a solution to those problems.</p>

       <p>Kraken2 wrapped for KBase by <a href="mailto:mflynn@lanl.gov">Mark Flynn</a> and <a href="mailto:chienchi@lanl.gov">Chienchi Lo</a> as part of DOE SFA funded codevelopment with KBase.</p>
